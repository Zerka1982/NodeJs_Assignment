This is my solved task  using "Node.js & Express".

Technologies used are : 
- Node.js
- Express
- Express Messages, Session, Connect Flash & Validation
- MongoDB & Mongoose
- Pug Templating
- Passport.js Authentication
- BCrypt Hashing
- Bootstrap

Installation

Install all dependencies using 
npm install <package name>

To Run thhe application
npm start 

Optional: 
Install nodemon for watching any changes in the files.


N.B
This is the first time I use Nodejs & express. I consider myself as a learner and beginner to these new technologies, however I am ready to learn more. 
The solved task was based on a series of youtube videos explaining how to create a login form. 

For the UI, still many things to improve. I ll keep improving this app in the near future.
